This study addresses overcurrent relay coordination in a 14-relay network, comparing a classic Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) single-step method. 
illustrate both Standard Inverse and Very Inverse relay characteristics, detail the role of a penalty factor in enforcing mainâ€“backup constraints, and present sensitivity analyses for various penalty values ranging from 100 to 100,000 in the RL environment. 
Numerical results show that GA consistently finds low-objective solutions with near-zero constraint violations.
In contrast, RL can yield either superior or inferior solutions depending on penalty magnitude and exploration settings.
